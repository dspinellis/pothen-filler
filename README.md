# Pothen-filler

These are examples of JavaScript functions that may help automate some
of the work required for filling the Greek personal wealth declaration forms
(Πόθεν Έσχες).
They are to be executed from the web browser console, after navigating to the
corresponding part of the declaration and selecting an appropriate element.
They are provided only as a starting point and require tailoring and
adjustment for individual circumstances.
